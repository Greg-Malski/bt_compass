Sparrow's Compass
--------------------------------------
This datapack adds a new rare item to Shipwrecks: a mystical compass that points directly to Buried Treasure.

Designed to solve the frustration of the "Red X" on buried treasure maps, this compass guides you to the exact digging spot without needing to decipher chunk coordinates.

FEATURES:
- Sparrow's Compass has a 25% chance to appear in Shipwreck "Map Chests" alongside the standard Buried Treasure Map.
- The compass locks onto the nearest Buried Treasure when held.
- Compass can be recalibrated when thrown onto the ground.

HOW TO USE:
- Find a Shipwreck
- Loot the Map Chest
- Hold the compass in your main hand. You will hear the map-writing sound, and the needle will lock onto the nearest treasure.
- Follow the compass until it spins.

RECALIBRATION:
Minecraft generates Buried Treasure chests frequently. Sometimes, the "Map" you found points to a distant chest, but the Compass detects a closer one nearby.

To fix this: Use the map to get close to the chest, then drop the compass on the ground. You will hear a hiss sound, and once you put the compass back in your hand, it will recalibrate to the nearest buried treasure.
